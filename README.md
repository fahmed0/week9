# Poisonous Mushrooms project
# Mushroom Classification

This project aims to predict if a mushroom is poisonous or not, based on its characteristics, using various machine learning models.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Mushroom Classification" dataset from Kaggle, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification). The dataset contains information on different mushroom attributes, including a label indicating if they are poisonous or edible.

## Features

The dataset includes the following features:

- Cap Shape
- Cap Surface
- Cap Color
- Bruises
- Odor
- Gill Attachment
- Gill Spacing
- Gill Size
- Gill Color
- Stalk Shape
- Stalk Root
- Stalk Surface Above Ring
- Stalk Surface Below Ring
- Stalk Color Above Ring
- Stalk Color Below Ring
- Veil Type
- Veil Color
- Ring Number
- Ring Type
- Spore Print Color
- Population
- Habitat

## Machine Learning Models

We used the following supervised machine learning models in this project:

1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
3. Decision Tree
4. Random Forest

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required Python packages: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the models.

## Results

The accuracy scores of the models are as follows:

- KNN accuracy: 0.9963084495488105
- SVM accuracy: 0.961033634126333
- Decision Tree accuracy: 1.0
- Random Forest accuracy: 1.0
